# Materials
This repo contains materials for courses that I teach.

I try to keep this relatively organized, which can be difficult since I am constantly updating and creating new material as the school year continues.

You are free to use anything you find.

More worksheets can be found [on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QAb6xTlR76DUH-0-w7JpNRaI-j9C3kqE?usp=sharing).
