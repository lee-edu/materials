# GridWorld
GridWorld is a graphical environment that helps visualize the behavior of objects. It was used in the CS AP exams, but we will be taking it in another direction. [You can read more on the GridWorld website.](https://horstmann.com/gridworld/gridworld-manual.html)

## Setup
Clone [this repository]() and open the GridGames folder with VS Code. It should open as a Java project. If it does not, make sure you have the **Extension Pack for Java** installed. You might also have to first open a `.java` file, which can be found in the `projects` directory.

The `gridWorld` directory contains the base code for GridWorld. **Do not edit any files in this directory!** It is purely for reference.

You will be working in the `projects` directory. Browse through the existing projects. Also notice that in `.vscode/settings.json`, each project folder has been added. This is required in order to run the projects through VS Code.

Run `BugRunner.java` in `firstProject`. A GUI (Graphical User Interface) should appear. Figure out what the `Step`, `Run`, and `Stop` buttons do. Try changing the slider as well from `Slow` to `Fast`.

## Case Study

This section is pulled from the [CollegeBoard GridWorld Student Manual](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/apc/GridWorld_Case_Study_Student_Manual_with_Appendixes_Aug_2007_updated.pdf). Feel free to flip through

## Problem Set #1: Fancy Bugs

1. Create a rainbow bug that changes color with each step.
2. Create a rectangle bug that takes two parameters: l, w; it should draw a rectangle with length l and width w.
3. Create a randombug that turns and moves randomly with each step.
4. Create a polygon bug that takes two parameters : n and s; it should draw a regular n-gon that has sides of length s.
