# Project Proposal

You may work _individually_ or _in groups_ for this project. This project will last until the _end of second semester_. You will have a total of **8 weeks** to work on this project.

## Task
You have a week to come up with a feasible idea for your project. Submit a document that answers the following questions. If you want to continue working on your project from last semester, this document should indicate how what you're doing this semester is _substantial_.

1. What is your project idea?
2. What are your motivations for this idea?
3. What new computer science topics will you need to learn to complete your project?
4. What are the major goals of your project? Be as specific as you can. Include details such as:

   - What code needs to be working?
   - What documentation needs to be written?
   - What issues / problems need to be resolved?
   - What tasks need to be completed?
   - And so on...

   This should give a good indication of your minimum viable product (MVP). In other words, what would you be happy with and proud of at the end of this semester?

5. Provide a rough 8 week outline of your project goals.
6. What additional features and extensions would you like to add given more time?
7. _If you are working as a group_, detail what each member of the group will be responsible for, and how the work will be distributed.

## Project Deliverables

Once I have approved your proposal, you are free to start working on your project! Throughout the rest of the semester, I will also be assigning some writing assignments to help keep you on track, and also to help you document your process for portfolio building. These deliverables might include sketches, prototypes, design documents, peer critiques, code reviews, and presentations.
