# Project Proposal
You may work *individually* or in *pairs* on this project. This project will last until the *end of first semester*, so you will have roughly 8 weeks to work on this project.

## Overview
You all have solid foundations in computer science. This project will be a chance for you to show off what you've learned, bring in your own interests, and continue to develop and learn new skills.

## Task
Submit a document that answers the following questions:

1. What is your project idea?
2. What are your motivations for this idea?
3. What new computer science topics will you need to learn to complete your project?
4. What are the major goals of your project? Be as specific as you can. Include details such as:
   - What code needs to be working?
   - What documentation needs to be written?
   - What issues / problems need to be resolved?
   - What tasks need to be completed?
   - And so on...

   This should give a good indication of your minimum viable product (MVP). In other words, what would you be happy with and proud of at the end of this semester?
1. Provide a rough 8 week outline of your project goals.
2. What additional features and extensions would you like to add given more time?

## Project Deliverables
Once I have approved your proposal, you are free to start working on your project! Throughout the rest of the semester, I will also be assigning some writing assignments to help keep you on track, and also to help you document your process for portfolio building. These deliverables might include sketches, prototypes, design documents, peer critiques, code reviews, and presentations.
