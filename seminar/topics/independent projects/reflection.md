# Project Reflection
We've reached the end of first semester, and with that, your projects are also coming to an end!

## Overview
Reflections are useful to help you look back on the experience you've gained, what you've accomplished, and how much you've learned. It's also a chance to think about what could have gone better, so that your projects are better in the future!

## Preparation
You should have the following documents readily accessible as you write this reflection:
  - Project proposal
  - Project check-ins
  - Project peer critique notes

You are allowed (and encouraged) to pull material from your previous documents as you write this reflection!

## Task
Submit a document (minimum ~300 words) that answers the following questions. Treat this as a formal write-up. Proofread your work!

1. What major goals of your project did you accomplish?
2. What new material did you learn as you worked on this project?
3. Which aspect of your project are you most proud of, and why?
4. Which aspect of your project would you have done differently if given the chance, and why?
5. What new features would you add to your project if you were given more time, and why?
6. What new material / skills would you like to learn that you weren't able to pick up during this project?
7. How was your experience working on a project alone / with a partner? How did you work well alone / together, and what could have been improved?
