# Peer Critique

## Phase 1: Present (~15 minutes)
Each team should get 5 minutes presenting their work. While the presenting team is going through the following prompts, the other team should write down notes.

1. Give a brief overview of your project.
2. What design choices have you made so far? (e.g. your code, classes, project structure, visual design, etc)
3. What is your team working on now?
4. What challenges has your team run into?
5. What feedback are you hoping to get from the other team?

After 5 minutes, switch off so the team who hasn't presented now presents, and the other team takes notes.

## Phase 2: Cross Talk (~15 minutes)
After both teams have presented, take some time to ask each other _constructive_ criticism. Try to make the other team explain their thought process as much as possible. Examples include:

  - Can you elaborate on why you made _X_ decision?
  - This feature seems really cool! How do you plan on implementing it?
  - You seem really excited about _X_. Could you explain how it fits in with your larger goals?
  - This seems super ambitious and I'm not sure if we have enough time to do that. What's your plan for scaling this down?

In general, be specific with your feedback, and offer suggestions! Keep in mind that you don't _need_ to take every suggestion you get.

## Phase 3: Reflection (~20 minutes)
Share your notes with each other. Each team should then write a document that includes responses to the following:

1. **Describe** the feedback you received from the other team.
2. **Assess** how well that feedback applies to your project. What was most helpful?
3. **Plan** how you will apply the feedback. What revisions will you make to your project? What is going well? What needs to be worked on?
