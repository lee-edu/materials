# HTML
The [w3schools HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) is a great resource to start learning HTML. It's also a great place to look for HTML documentation!

## Questions
  1. What does HTML stand for?
  2. What is the syntax for writing HTML?
  3. Explain what `<head>` and `<body>` are and what they should contain.
  4. What are **semantic elements**, and why are they preferable to regular HTML elements?
  5. What is the **DOM**?

## Project
Your team will be making a website. You are free to choose a theme to base the website around. Some examples are magazines, sports, clubs, shows, etc.

### Index Page
The contents of this page are up to your discretion, but should involve work from each team member. This will be the landing page of your website and should be made accordingly. This page should include:
  - a title
  - links to each individual page
  - one or more images with alt text

### Individual Pages
Each member of your team should create their own page. This page should include:
  - your name
  - a title
  - a link to the index page
  - an ordered list
  - an unordered list
  - paragraphs
  - headings
  - a few images with alt text

## Submission
Submit a link to your repo along with a drawing of the **DOM tree** for your `index.html`. Your repo should include a `README` that explains what your website is about.
