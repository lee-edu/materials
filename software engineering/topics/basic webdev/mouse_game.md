# Mouse Accuracy Game
You will be working in teams of 3 to create a mouse accuracy game from scratch.

## Objectives
This project will assess your ability to:
- Make a web application that uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Style your website using CSS
- Use Javascript to generate random elements and style them
- Use Javascript to handle user events

## Task
Use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a mouse accuracy game. The game is described as follows:
1. The game does not start until the user presses a "Start" button.
2. Once the game has started, the user has a set amount of time (usually 30 seconds or a minute) to click on targets that randomly appear in the viewport. These targets are described as follows:
   1. The targets take a set amount of time to grow larger when they appear, and then take a set amount of time to shrink until they disappear.
   2. You can decide the speed, size, and shape of the targets that appear and disappear.
   3. If the user clicks on a target, that target will disappear.
3. Once the time has elapsed, clear all targets from the screen and display a scoreboard. This scoreboard should include the following information for the user:
   1. The total amount of targets that appeared
   2. The number of targets that the user successfully clicked on
   3. A score based on the above two numbers. You can decide how to calculate this score.
4. *(Bonus)* You can add more features to this game, such as difficulty settings, choosing the color and shape of the targets, and allowing a user to set how long they want to play.

## Write-up

4. What part of this project are you most proud of, and why?
5. Cite any sources you used.

## Submission
