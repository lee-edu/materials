# Javascript
We'll start off by using Javascript in its original domain: websites.

Read the [Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) to start off; it provides an in-depth overview of Javascript syntax, as well as examples of how it can be used in tandem with HTML and CSS.

## Questions
1. What is the difference between `let` and `const`? Why would you use one over the other?
2. Describe what `document.querySelector()` does. What does `document` refer to?
3. What is an **event** and **event handler**? Give an example of each.
4. What is the benefit of an external Javascript file vs Javascript inside `<script>` tags?
5. How do you link a Javascript file to an HTML document?

## Practice
For these practice scenarios, you should create an HTML file that you can test with.
1. Create a counter that goes up by one every time a button is pressed.
2. Create a button that adds the character "!" to its own text every time it's pressed.
3. Create a link whose text mirrors whatever the user types in a text input box.
4. Create a paragraph and three buttons; each button should change the text color of the paragraph to a different color.
5. Create a paragraph and a drop-down menu with font selections. Choosing an option should change the font of the paragraph.
