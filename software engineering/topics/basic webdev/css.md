# CSS
[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) provides a great CSS tutorial if you've never seen CSS before!

## Questions
1. What does **CSS** stand for?
2. Describe the *syntax* for writing CSS.
3. What is a **class**? How is it different from an **ID**?
4. What is a CSS **selector**?
5. Explain the difference between these units: `px`, `em`, `vw`, `%`, `rem`

## Practice
For each scenario, write the CSS that would meet the specification.
1. Paragraphs have no padding but vertical margins of `1.5vh`
2. Links with class `--inline` are not underlined until they are hovered over
3. The first child of `ol` and `ul` have a background color of light grey
4. Any element with class `Button` will change the cursor to a `pointer` when moused over
5. Any element with class `Modal` is positioned directly at the center of the page and will not move when the page is scrolled
