# Using the Terminal

## Model A | Getting Started with Terminus
Do these questions as you play Terminus. If you don't know the answer, talk with your group -- you might just need to play a little more!

1. Which **terminal** command(s) allow you to:
    1. Figure out your current location?
    1. Move to a different location?
    1. See the contents of a file?
1. Draw a map of the `Western Forest`. You can use paper or the whiteboard!
1. What is the `path`:
    1. from `WesternForest` to `Lessons`
    1. from `SpellcastingAcademy` to `StataCenter`
1. Define the **syntax** for a terminal command. Explain.
1. What do the following terminal commands do?
    1. `pwd`
    1. `mv`
    1. `man`
1. What do `..` and `.` represent?

### STOP HERE! Presenters should check in with the teacher.

1. How do you figure out what a terminal command does?

1. What does it mean if a path starts with a `/`? What if a path doesn't start with a `/`?

    1. `mv bigFile.dat ../BigStorage/BigDrawer`
    1. `rm /mnt/d/garbage.can`
    1. `cat ../../secretFile.key`
    1. `cp ../../glue.glu crafts/paper`

## Model C | Your Own Terminal
If you are using Windows, open the Windows Terminal app. If you are using Mac, open the Terminal app.

1. Try using the commands you learned from Terminus to navigate through your own folders. What directory do you start in when you first open terminal?
1. Run the commands `cd ~` and then `mkdir sandbox`. What happens?
1. `cd sandbox` before trying the following commands:
    1. `man`
    1. `pwd`
    1. `ls`
    1. `cd`
    1. `mkdir`
    1. `touch`
    1. `cat`
    1. `mv`
    1. `cp`
    1. `rm`
    1. `rmdir`
    1. `echo`

**WARNING: ONLY USE THESE COMMANDS ON FILES AND FOLDERS INSIDE YOUR SANDBOX FOLDER!**
