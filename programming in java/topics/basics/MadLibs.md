# Mad Libs
[Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) is a word game where the player is asked to provide a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story that is revealed later. You will be writing a Java version of this game.

## Example
Here's an example of what running a madlibs program would look like:
```
> java MadLibs
Adjective: > queasy
Big number: > 239
Plural noun: > cows
Past-tense verb: > jumped

You were late to class because you were feeling *queasy*. You were just walking along when all of a sudden you saw *239* of them! There were *239* *cows* that *jumped* at you!
```

## Task
Write a `MadLibs.java` program.
  - Ask the player for *at least* 5 Strings and 3 numbers
  - Use that input to fill in the blanks for a story
  - Your story should be at least one paragraph

Make sure that the first line of the program is your name in a comment!
