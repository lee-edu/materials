# Data Fabrication

#### *or, how to use probability, simulations, and estimations to stop pretending your data is "good"*



## Goals of this unit:
1. Develop familiarity with probabilistic reasoning around random variables, expected value, and the law of large numbers
2. Create a data-based story that is interesting and fun to read
3. Write code to simulate large numbers of trials of probabilistic experiments in order to estimate true values
4. Use Fermi estimation to approximate numerical values


## End product: 
By the end of this unit you will create a data story in the style of Randall Munroe's *What If*.

### Let's start out by reading an example: 

What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/ 



We'll read another example when we talk about Fermi estimation, but this is a starting point to get you thinking about what story you might want to tell and how you might tell it.
