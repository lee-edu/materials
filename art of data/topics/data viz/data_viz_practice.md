  # Data Viz Analysis Practice

  For each of the following visualizations, answer the following questions:
  1. What variables are shown in this visualization?
  2. Identify the marks and the scale that is being used (i.e. which variable -> which channel).
  3. What is the purpose of the visualization?
  4. Is the visualization effective? Elaborate.
