# Descriptive Stats & Viz Review

![](img/college_songs.png)

1. These charts summarize a dataset about college fight songs — specifically, the number of times the word “fight” appears in each song. The box plot is missing a left whisker because $Q0 = Q1 = 0$. Using the $1.5IQR$ rule, would an observation of 16 be considered an outlier? If so, would you consider that a false positive? Explain.

2. What do these quartiles tell us about the *shape* and *spread* of the distribution? Explain.

| Q0  | Q1  | Q2  | Q3  | Q4  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 10  | 21  | 28  | 37  | 50  |

4. Examine the following contingency table and fill in the conditional proportions accordingly. Based on this information, do you think there exists an association between enjoying sports and liking candy? Explain.

|                       | Likes candy | Dislikes candy | Total |
| :-------------------: | :---------: | :------------: | :---: |

| Does not enjoy sports |     158     |       91       |  249  |

|                       | Likes candy | Dislikes candy | Total |  n  |
| :-------------------: | :---------: | :------------: | ----- | :-: |

5. `total_employed` is the number of librarians in the respective area. Describe a visualization that would support an answer to the following question. Explain any decisions you make, including (but not limited to) marks, channels, and labels.

   > How many librarians are employed in each area?

6. `location_quotient` measures the proportion of librarians to total population, specifically, per 1000 people. Describe a visualization that would support an answer to the following question. explain any decisions you make, including (but not limited to) marks, channels, and labels.

   > Is there a relationship between state and location_quotient? i.e. Are librarians more common in some states than others?
