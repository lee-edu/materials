### Variables, Conditionals ###

# 1) Return the sum of the two parameters
def add(x, y):
  return

# 2) Return the larger number
def larger(x, y):
  return

# 3) Return True only when _exactly_ one input is True
def xor(a, b):
  return

### Loops ###

# 4) Print 'hello world' n times
def hello_n(n):
  return

# 5) Print the decimal representations of 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 ... 1/n
def fraction(n):
  return

# 6) Return the factorial of n (written as n!)
# ex: 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
def factorial(n):
  return

# 7) Print a triangle of stars according to n
# Hint: Use nested loops!
def stars(n):
  return

''' ex: stars(4) should print:
