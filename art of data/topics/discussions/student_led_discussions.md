# Student Led Discussion
An important skill for scientists to have is the ability to communicate complex ideas; you should know how to design a learning experience for others who are not experts.

## Objectives
- Engage with and research current / past events
- Facilitate a sustained conversation about a complex topic
- Challenge yourselves and others on preconceived notions

## Task
1. Sign up for one of the topics on [this spreadsheet]().
2. Find roughly 20 minutes of source material _one week_ before your discussion date. This assignment **should not** be behind a paywall; if it is, either find another source or distribute a non-paywalled version. Examples of materials include videos, articles, research studies, etc.
3. Write a 3 question quiz to check for understanding of the assigned material, which will be given to the other students in the class.
4. Prepare a ~30 minute plan for your discussion date. While you may organize it as you'd like, you can also follow this outline:
   1. 5 minutes: Quiz / Check In
   2. 5 minutes: Background / Presentation
   3. 5 minutes: Prompt w/ Individual Reflections
   4. 5 minutes: Pair Share
   5. 10 minutes: Class Discussion
5. Before your date, turn in a document that includes the following information (can be bullet points):
   - What are your objectives?
   - Your outline for the class period
      - including prompts, prepared questions, etc

> Note: You should anticipate what may come out of the individual reflections and discussions. That might mean having good follow up questions, other sources to point to, or even just a way to segue back to the original topic.
