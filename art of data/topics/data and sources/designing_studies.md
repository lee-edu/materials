# Designing Studies

## Review
1. What is the difference between a sample and a population?

## Types of Studies
1. What is the difference between an **observational** and an **experimental** study?
2. What is meant by the phrase "correlation, not causation"? Take a look at [Tyler Vigen's spurious correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) for some examples.
3. Why can't an observational study show causation?
4. What reasons might a researcher have for choosing one type of study over another?

## Sample Frame
1. What is a **sample frame**, and how is that different from a sample?
2. What does **coverage bias** (also called **exclusion bias**) mean in the context of choosing a sample frame?
3. Suppose a researcher were studying the population of all students at Horace Mann.
   1. Give an example of a sample frame that demonstrates coverage bias.
   2. What reasons might the researcher have for choosing that sample frame?
   3. What could the researcher do to reduce coverage bias?

## Sampling Methodology
1. What does it mean for a sample to be "good"?
2. What is the difference between **probability** and **nonprobability** sampling?
3. Give two examples of nonprobability sampling. What biases might these methods be prone to?
4. Give two examples of probability sampling. What biases might these methods be prone to?

## Practice
Choose one of the following situations:
  - A 3rd grade teacher is interested in childhood literacy development. Theyâ€™ve noticed that some students tend to perform better when asked to do reading tasks. The teacher is curious about what reading activities these students are doing at home.
  - An outdoor enthusiast recently went hiking, and found that some blueberries on the side of the trail were extremely sweet. However, other bushes on the same trail produced tasteless blueberries. The hiker is intrigued by what could be causing this difference.
  - An independent publisher is looking at printing presses to partner with. They are focused on newspapers and want to find a company that is experienced with newsprint paper. The publisher is thinking about what qualities to look for.

Then, for your chosen situation, write a response to the following:
1. Identify a statistical question you could ask in that situation.
2. Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the population would help answer your question?
3. Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.
4. Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?
5. What biases may come up, and how would you address them?
