# Designing Experiments

## Review
1. What is the difference between **independent** and **dependent** variables?
2. What is the difference between a **null** and **alternative** hypothesis?
3. How/why can experimental studies show causation?
4. How might sampling bias affect the results of an experiment?

## Designing an Experiment
1. Put these steps in the correct order:
     - Ask a precise question
     - Identify independent and dependent variables
     - Identify sample frame
     - Obtain sample to include in experiment
     - Identify population
     - Do background research
     - Conduct treatments on **control** and **experimental** groups
     - Choose sampling method
     - Identify **treatments**
     - Identify null and alternative hypotheses
2. What are some examples of how an experiment can go wrong? Refer to specific steps from the list above.
3. How might an error affect the trustworthiness of a study? How much *should* an error affect the trustworthiness of a study?
4. What might a scientist do to prevent such errors?
5. What does it mean to **double blind** a study?
